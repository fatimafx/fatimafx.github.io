  <p id = "mycorner"> <em> Hey, my name  is Fatima. I'm 16 years old. I'm going to be a junior. I live in Brooklyn. My favorite color is blue as you can tell by my backgroud color. I have three siblings. I am the youngest in my family. I
                      love to bake. I watch Netflix in my free time. I don't like
                      to read books. I like to play with my nieces and nephews. I like to go on road trips.
                      I get bored easily. I think panda's are adorable. I am very lazy i can stay in my bed all day. I like baking brownies but i'm not that good at baking so my mom helps me most of the time.
